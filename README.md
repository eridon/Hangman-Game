# Hangman Game

A simple implementation of the popular word-guessing game, Hangman. The player attempts to correctly guess a randomly generated word by entering one letter at a time. The game displays the number of letters in the word, with underscores representing unguessed letters. If the player correctly guesses a letter, the underscores for that letter are replaced by the correctly guessed letter. If the player's guess is incorrect, they lose one life. After 4 incorrect guesses, the player receives a hint about the word. The game continues until the player either correctly guesses the word or runs out of lives.
